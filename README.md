# PPM Geometry

In this repo im just playing around with the ![ppm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm#File_formats) image format.

I found out about this image format by watching a ![video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJIyRE2vZ_0) from tsoding.

In this repo im just testing with the PPM image format.
